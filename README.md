# Bountiful

A meal-kit delivery website that donates every meal you purchase to a foodbank near you


## Background information

This was part of my first web development & design course whilst studying Interactive Media Management at Sheridan College in Canada! The idea was to combine 2 things that I thought would blend well together: a meal kit delivery service, and an effortless way to donate more to food banks near your location. 

The primary goal for the user was to create a profile through the website and ultimately subscribe to a mealplan, choose a delivery day, time & amount of meals per week. When subscribing to a mealplan, the user has the option of donating the very same mealkit, or a dollar amount value, to a foodbank near their delivery location. Currently, I hardcoded the location based on Postal Code, but eventually I'd like to be able to learn more coding to expand on the website. 

### Description of functionality

Since this was my first independent web development project, I avoided using frameworks so I could get a firm grasp on the basics. These are the languages I picked up and implemented to create Bountiful:


* PHP & PDO for server-side
* MYSQL for database interactions with PHPMyAdmin
* HTML & CSS using flexbox 
* Vanilla Javascript to create more interactivity, like: slideshow, menu items & form validation
